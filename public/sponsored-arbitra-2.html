    <h1>Unlock Alpha — Arbitra’s AI Signal Suite</h1>
    <div class="byline">By Arbitra Labs • Sponsored Content</div>

    <p>Alpha in crypto comes from acting on the right signal at the right time. Arbitra’s AI-backed signal suite is designed to surface those signals with clarity and context, letting traders move decisively without sacrificing safety or transparency.</p>

    <h2>What Arbitra provides</h2>
    <p>Arbitra combines quantitative signal engines, unified portfolio tracking, and automated execution. The result is a single system where discovery, analysis, and execution live together — reducing the manual friction that often kills performance.</p>

    <h3>Signal scoring with clear reasons</h3>
    <p>Every signal Arbitra surfaces is accompanied by a numeric score and a short rationale. Whether it’s a volume surge, a breakout, funding-rate divergence, or a reversal candidate, you get:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A composite score (0–100) highlighting probability and confidence.</li>
      <li>A concise list of contributing factors (e.g., "RSI oversold", "Price below 20 MA", "2.5× volume spike").</li>
      <li>A recommended action tier (Watch, Consider, Act) to speed decision-making.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How reversal and breakout detection differ</h3>
    <p>Reversal detection uses multi-timeframe, multi-factor analysis to identify potential market bottoms and tops. It focuses on sustained patterns over days to weeks. Breakouts and volume alerts, by contrast, are optimized for short- to medium-term momentum plays and prioritize liquidity and immediate execution.</p>

    <blockquote>"We built Arbitra to give traders not just data, but actionable context — so they can move quickly with conviction."</blockquote>

    <h2>Real-world use cases</h2>
    <h3>Swing traders</h3>
    <p>Use the reversal scanner to find probable entry windows and the automated order rules to size positions and set stop-loss levels. The 12-hour and daily analyses help reduce noise and improve hold-time decisions.</p>

    <h3>Momentum traders</h3>
    <p>Enable breakout and volume alerts with tight execution rules. Arbitra prioritizes pairs by liquidity and recent volume, so you receive alerts you can realistically trade.</p>

    <h3>Portfolio managers</h3>
    <p>See unified balances and P&L across exchanges, enforce risk limits, and run strategy performance reports — all from a single dashboard.</p>

    <h2>Security and integrations</h2>
    <p>Arbitra connects via exchange APIs with granular permissions—read-only for monitoring or trading keys when you enable automated execution. API keys are stored encrypted and never leave your control. Audit logs and per-strategy permissions provide governance for team accounts and funds.</p>

    <h2>Examples — what a signal looks like</h2>
    <p>Example: <em>BTCUSDT</em> reversal candidate — Score: 72 (STRONG)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>RSI: 32 (near oversold)</li>
      <li>Price 12% below MA-20 and 18% below MA-50</li>
      <li>Volume spike 2.2× the 20-period average</li>
      <li>Recommendation: Consider buying with 1–2% risk per position</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Example: <em>ALTCoinUSDT</em> breakout alert — Score: 65 (MEDIUM)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>24h quote volume in top 20 of scanned pairs</li>
      <li>Price closed above consolidation range with 2.8× volume</li>
      <li>Recommendation: Enter on pullback or breakout retest</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>Sign up for a free trial, connect your exchange APIs, and run the scanners on live data. We recommend starting with the signal feed in "Watch" mode to observe behavior, then moving to automated execution once you’ve validated signal alignment with your strategy.</p>
